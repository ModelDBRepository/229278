<p>System requirements: 
</p>
<p>Use of this code requires installation of MATLAB (<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/">https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/</a>) and the tapas toolbox (<a href="https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/software/tapas/documentations/hgf-toolbox-v30.html">https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/software/tapas/documentations/hgf-toolbox-v30.html</a>) as well as data generated by the Conditioned Hallucinations task 1.0.

<p>Documentation regarding the input and output variables are found in individual functions.  
</p>
<p>The following basic classes of functions are included (input: CH data structure):
</p>
<p>ch_hgf_analysis - basic analysis of CH data with no constraints on parameters.
</p>
<p>ch_hgf_calcx - calculation of x trajectory 
</p>
<p>ch_hgf_sim - generation of synthetic data using parameters fit from CH data.  
</p>

<p>The sub-types of functions (_startpoints, _nu, _nu2) correspond to
functions that constrain initial model parameters by: 1) decreased
precision on prior for trajectory starting points; 2) adding the
variable nu that encodes relative
weighting of priors versus sensory evidence precision in leading to
decision-making; and 3) decreased precision on prior for nu.</p>
